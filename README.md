## My process
I started by properly observing the projects to decide on what approach in terms of color and structure to start with. I started with HTML structure and used CSS to follow through the design from the top down to the bottom.

### Built with 
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned
I learnt some new color designs using the hsl property.
I also improved with the use of flexbox in CSS.
Flex-box is powerful and amazing, it helps for greater and better alignment.


### Continued development
For me this area will be the Grid in CSS, tranform and HSL color property for now.

### Useful resources

- [README.md](https://www.frontendmentor.com/project) - This helped me for proper documentary. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
